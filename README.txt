# Assignment 4

All code is written in Python with two main driver scripts for each problem in their respective directories: forest_mgmt and frozen_lake.

The scripts can be invoked quite easily by running:

python3 forest_mgmt_driver.py plots/

python3 frozen_lake_driver.py plots/

Each script implements Value Iteration, Policy Iteration, and Q-Learning to each problem. I've updated the requirements.txt file which should contain all libraries needed for these scripts which were written and executed using python3.

If you have any mis-understandings I would simply open each of these decomposition scripts as they're quite simple in nature. If you have any queries still, feel free to email me at akogler3@gatech.edu.
